The code in this directory is for experimenting with different model parameters to optimize the significance of the results.
However, the significance of the corpus does not necessary mean that it is the most meaningful model and the ultimate
decision for the best model should depend on whether the topics make sense.

The significance score calculated is the model's log perplexity. The model is trained on 2/3 of the corpus and then
tested on the other 1/3.
